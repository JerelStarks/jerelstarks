# Jerel Nelson Starks 👨‍💻

## SDET & Senior Software QA Engineer | Cypress / Playwright & TypeScript Expert

📍 Silicon Valley (Bay Area, California) & Silicon Slopes (Salt Lake City Metropolitan Area, Utah)

### About Me

I'm a results-driven and innovative **Software Development Engineer in Test** (SDET) with over 10 years of experience in software quality assurance, specializing in test automation (Cypress and Playwright with TypeScript). I excel at ensuring high-quality software and building robust testing solutions. My diverse background includes creating detailed test plans, developing functional test cases, and identifying and reporting defects, all while utilizing relevant tools and technologies like TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, Git, and others to fine-tune test processes, quality standards, and STLC workflows.

My passion extends to creating innovative solutions such as up-skilling initiatives, UX design libraries, and templates that increase efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction. I enjoy mentoring and providing constructive feedback to product and engineering teams, which leads to successful project outcomes.

### Proud Contributions

Throughout my career, I have made significant contributions that have had a positive impact on the teams and projects I have been a part of. Some of these contributions include:

1. **Fridaymation Initiative at Rightsline**: I organized an up-skilling program called "Fridaymation" for associate-level QA engineers to teach them Cypress and TypeScript. This initiative increased QA bandwidth, accelerated regression and smoke testing, and improved code quality reporting.

2. **Mentorship at NewFold Digital**: I mentored a new QA engineer who was transferred from the Customer Experience department. By providing ISTQB learning materials, peer-testing, and regular 1:1's, the new QA engineer successfully ramped up to handle their new job responsibilities.

3. **Design Library and Guidelines at Arcserve**: While testing a web portal called "ShadowControl," I created and demoed a new design library and guidelines driven by feedback received from QA and issues that arose during QA testing. This new design library sparked a significant discourse within the engineering organization and led to the implementation of many aspects of the design library.

4. **UX Design and Email Template Improvements at RoviTracker Incorporated**: I created numerous UX artifacts, including a new user onboarding stepper for companies looking to use RoviTracker for their heavy equipment tracking. Additionally, I designed and implemented a new email template that is still in use today. These contributions received a lot of positive feedback and improved the overall user experience.

I am continually looking for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with the tech community to drive innovation and share knowledge.
